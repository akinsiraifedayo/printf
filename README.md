Project Title: PRINTF

Project Description:
	This is a printf project that is intended to test our understanding of C by designing our own printf function that would have all the functionalities of the normal printf
	The printf was totally written in C programming language
	This project was done as a collaboration between OKOYE AMARACHUKWU and IFEDAYO OLYMPICSON AKINSIRA-OLUMIDE

Running the project: You should add a main.c file that calls the function in the same way you would call a traditional printf but with a _printf instead.
